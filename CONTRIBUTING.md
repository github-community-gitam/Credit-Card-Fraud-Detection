## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the project! To maintain a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. How to Contribute
- Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `git checkout -b bugfix/your-fix`).
- Make your changes, ensuring they follow the code style and standards.
- Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
- Push to your fork (`git push origin your-branch`).
- Create a pull request (PR) with a clear description of the changes.

### 2. Code Style and Standards
- Write meaningful commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X").
- Keep your code modular and document complex functions or logic with comments.

### 3. Pull Request Process
- Submit your PR to the `main` branch.
- Ensure that your PR is focused and addresses only one issue or adds one feature at a time.
- Link your PR to relevant issues if applicable.
- Once submitted, your PR will be reviewed. You may be asked to make changes before it is merged.
- After approval, your PR will be merged by a maintainer.

### 4. Reporting Issues
- If you find any bugs or have feature requests, please create an issue and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant logs or error messages.
